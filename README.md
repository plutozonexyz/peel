Privacy Enabled Electronic Letters

WIP (Work In Progress)

## What is PEEL?
PEEL is planned to be an electonic way of sending letters that are encrypted via PGP. It is going to be written in Python 3.7.

## Why?
I decided that I wanted to make a more secure version of e-mail, using PGP as a backend. Not much else, was just an idea.

## Installation instructions?
Use the Releases tab. If there are none, please wait until PEEL is stable enough for a release to be put up.
Dependencies are:
- Python 3.7
- Pip
- PGPy (`pip install PGPy`)
